Zsh starter module
-------

Login shells are the programs that users interact with. They interpret
commands typed at the command line. We would like to provide a new shell
for our users. This requires that we install a package, and also customize
configuration file(s). The configuration file(s) should be updated after the
package is installed, just in case the package installs a default and
overwrites our customizations.
